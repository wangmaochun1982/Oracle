###############Manually resolve archive log gap/ Recover Standby / Manual Standby recovery###############

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~on the STANDBY database~~~~~~~~~~
Identify the missing log sequence numbers by running this SQL:

SQL> select thread#, low_sequence#, high_sequence#  from v$archive_gap;


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~on the PRIMARY database~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Identify the filenames of the missing logs by running this SQL :

SQL>SELECT   NAME
FROM   V$ARCHIVED_LOG
WHERE   DEST_ID = 1 AND SEQUENCE# BETWEEN &Low_Sequence AND &High_Sequence;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Cancel managed recovery in the STANDBY database

SQL> ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE CANCEL;

2. Copy the missing archive redo logs from primary to standby server.

We assume here that the redo files are going to the same location on the standby server.

3. Recover the STANDBY database

SQL> RECOVER AUTOMATIC STANDBY DATABASE;

When all logs have been applied Oracle will ask for the next, as yet unarchived, redo log. At this point cancel the recovery, e.g.
Specify log: {<RET>=suggested | filename | AUTO | CANCEL}
CANCEL

4. Put the STANDBY database back into managed recovery mode:

SQL> ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ on the STANDBY database~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
5. Check that the archive redo gaps have been resolved byt running thie SQL:

SQL> select thread#, low_sequence#, high_sequence# from v$archive_gap;
